# Churn Predictions 
This project uses machine learning models to predict customer churn. 

## Data Used 
The project uses the following: 
- **Customer Data**: Contains customer behaviour and other relevant information. 
- **Churn Data**: Includes information on customers who have churned (no longer customers). 

## Analysis 
The project aims to answer the following questions: 
1. What factors are associated with customer churn? 
2. How can we use machine learning models to predict customer churn? 3. What are the most important features for predicting customer churn? 

## Methodology 
The project uses the following methods: 
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the datasets for analysis. 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using EDA to understand the distribution of the data and identify potential relationships between variables. 
- **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most important features for predicting customer churn. 
- **Model Training**: Training machine learning models (e.g., KNN, Random Forest, Histogram-based Gradient Boosting) to predict customer churn. 
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and others. 

## Results 
The project is in progress, and the results will be updated as the analysis progresses.

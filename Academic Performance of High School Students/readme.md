# Academic Performance of High School Students
This project analyzes the academic performance of high school students using various datasets and statistical methods.

## Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:
- **High School Data**: Contains student demographics, academic performance, and other relevant information.
- **Parental Involvement Data**: Includes information on parents' involvement in their children's education.
- **Socioeconomic Status Data**: Contains data on the socioeconomic status of the students and their families.

## Analysis
The project aims to answer the following questions:
1. What factors are associated with academic performance in high school students?
2. How do parental involvement and socioeconomic status affect academic performance?
3. Is there a correlation between high school performance and future academic success?

## Methodology
The project uses the following methods:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the datasets for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of the data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Using correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
- **Regression Analysis**: Using regression analysis to model the relationship between academic performance and various factors.

## Results
The project is currently in progress, and the results will be updated as the analysis progresses.

## Future Work
- **Additional Data Collection**: Collecting additional data to improve the analysis.
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Using more advanced statistical methods to analyze the data.
- **Model Improvement**: Improving the regression model to better predict academic performance.
